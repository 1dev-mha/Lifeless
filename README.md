- Very Bad Code

## Lifeless
- Made for the 6th Major Jam in around 72 hours
- `python main.py`
- In order to run the server, first run `server.py` and then connect with `main.py`. If 2 players connected already or you connected twice from the same computer, restart the server as I didn't implement good error and connection handling.
